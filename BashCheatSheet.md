# variables
see [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8748831/when-do-we-need-curly-braces-around-shell-variables).
```bash
var=10
# ALWAYS USE ${var}, not $var
"${foo}bar" # expand the variable foo
# Curly braces are also unconditionally required when:
${array[42]} # expanding array elements
${filename%.*} # using parameter expansion operations (remove extension)
```

# $(command) = \`command\`
Run the command and return its stdout. $() is better if you have nested command.

# double/single quotes
Single quotes do not interpret the things inside it (treat them as string). 
Double quotes evaluate the variables.
```bash
MYVAR=sometext 
echo "double quotes gives you $MYVAR" # quotes gives you sometext
echo 'single quotes gives you $MYVAR' # single quotes gives you $MYVAR
